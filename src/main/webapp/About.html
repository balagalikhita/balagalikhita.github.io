        <h2 class="heading4">Online doctor appointment platforms typically maintain a history of appointment records, including the date and time of each appointment. This history allows users to keep track of their past appointments and reference them as needed. The specific format and details provided in the appointment history may vary depending on the platform, but it commonly includes the following information:
    
            Date: The date on which the appointment was scheduled or took place.
            Time: The specific time of the appointment, indicating when it was scheduled or occurred.
            Doctor/Physician: The name or identifier of the healthcare professional with whom the appointment was made.
            Patient: The name or identifier of the patient who scheduled or attended the appointment.
            Appointment Details: Additional information about the appointment, such as the reason for the visit or any notes provided by the doctor.
        
        By referring to the appointment history, patients can review their past appointments, plan future visits, and have a record of their healthcare interactions for reference and continuity of care.</h2></div>
